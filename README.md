3. Add sandboxing https://github.com/nixpak/nixpak
4. Add more security
5. Gnome is running on x11 instead of wayland need to be fixed (don't know why i have this issue with gnome but not with the other desktop like KDE or Hyprland it's very annoying
6. Find a better waybar and hyprland.conf
7. KDE plasma6 is too unstable to be used sometimes librewolf or mullvad browser crash it's very annoying. I'm waiting for changes coming from KDE dev.
